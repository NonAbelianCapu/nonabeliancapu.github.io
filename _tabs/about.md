# About Me

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and a CONICET fellow, with a background in Physics from Universidad Nacional de La Plata. I am part of [SEDLab (Discrete Event Simulation Laboratory)](https://sedlab.dc.uba.ar/).

My work focuses on computational modeling for socio-economic systems, agent-based simulation, machine learning, and model validation. Current research lines include mixed-frequency nowcasting and calibration of complex simulation models.

Right now my main interest lies in the application of data-driven methods to build interpretable models of physical systems and complex systems in general. I also enjoy doing data science and data analysis more broadly.

I am also interested in technology transfer projects where applied AI and data science methods can support decision-making workflows.

In my free time I like reading about history and economics.
