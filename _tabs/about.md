# About Me

Welcome to my personal site! This is where I share my explorations in Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics. I'm passionate about understanding the non-abelian nature of the world, from gauge theories to complex algorithms.

Stay tuned for posts on research, projects, and whatever else I'm currently pondering.
