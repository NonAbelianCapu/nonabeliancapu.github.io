# About Me

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and a CONICET fellow, with a background in Physics from Universidad Nacional de La Plata.

My work focuses on computational modeling for socio-economic systems, agent-based simulation, machine learning, and model validation. Current research lines include mixed-frequency nowcasting and calibration of complex simulation models.

I am also interested in technology transfer projects where applied AI and data science methods can support decision-making workflows.
